# jasmine-template
Template for Katas when using Jasmine. Uses Karma as a test-runner, and PhantomJS for the test environment


Run `npm install` to get the deps and then `npm test` to run it. Karma will watch the files and run automatically

Tests go in `test/base-test.js` and must end in `test.js`

Code goes below the test. See the example class at the bottom of `test/base-test.js`
